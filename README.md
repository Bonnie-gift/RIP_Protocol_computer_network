# RIP_Protocol_computer_network
Realizing routing algorithm RIP protocol by using java

To realize the exchange of routing tables between nodes of the topology diagram above, it is required to display the exchange process of node routing tables and the contents of the routing tables saved by each node after each exchange. Finally, the node routing table becomes stable after several exchanges. 

To show how the RIP protocol deals with failure, it is allowed to input the router which suddenly does not work. It is required to display the exchange process of node routing tables and the contents of the routing tables saved by each node after each exchange. Finally, the node routing table becomes stable after several exchanges. 

To show the best solution, it is allowed to input the start router and the final network. It is required to show the shortest distance between the router and the network. Furthermore, it is required to display the specific path According to what is mentioned in the first part, information is changed according to certain time interval. Usually, the time interval is 30s. Considering the time, in our experiment, the time interval will be set in a much smaller value like 1.5s.
